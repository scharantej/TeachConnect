### Flask Application for Student Course Registration

**HTML Files**

1. **registration.html**: The main HTML page where students will provide their information and register for courses. This file will contain the registration form with input fields for student name, email, phone, and desired course.

2. **success.html**: This HTML page will be displayed after successful registration. It will contain a confirmation message and any additional information needed, such as a link to view registered courses.

**Routes**

1. **"/register"**: This route will handle the registration process. When a student submits the registration form, this route will be triggered. It will collect the student information and store it in a database or wherever appropriate. After successful registration, it will redirect the student to the success page.

2. **"/courses"**: This route will display a list of courses offered along with their schedules and details. Students can view this page to explore available courses and make informed decisions before registering.

3. **"/instructors"**: This route will display a list of instructors along with their profiles and contact information. Students can view this page to learn more about the instructors offering courses and choose the ones they prefer.

4. **"/schedule"**: This route will provide an interactive calendar or interface for students to view the schedule of each course. This will enable students to check for availability and choose courses that best fit their schedule.

5. **"/contact"**: This route will provide a contact form or email address where students can direct their queries or concerns regarding the courses or registration process. It will help establish a communication channel between students and the course administrators.

**Additional Considerations**

- The application should employ appropriate security measures to protect student data and prevent unauthorized access or misuse.
- The design should allow for easy expansion or integration with additional features or functionality in the future.
- Proper error handling and validation should be implemented to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Responsive design techniques should be used to ensure the application works well on various devices and screen sizes.

By implementing these HTML files and routes, you can create a functional Flask application that allows students to register for courses offered by tutors based on schedules. This application provides a convenient and user-friendly platform for student registration, promotes transparency, and facilitates better communication between students and course administrators.
